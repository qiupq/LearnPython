This is a paragraph that mentions bell peppers multiple times. For
one, here is a red pepper and dried tomato salad recipe. I don't like
to use green peppers in my salads as much because they have a harsher
flavor.

This second paragraph mentions red peppers and green peppers but not
the "s" word (s-a-l-a-d), so no bells should show up.

This third paragraph mentions red peppercorns and green peppercorns,
which aren't vegetables but spices (by the way, bell peppers really
aren't peppers, they're chilies, but would you rather have a good cook
or a good botanist prepare your salad?).
