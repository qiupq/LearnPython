This file records changes made to the book examples distribution package,
organized by examples release number.

1.0) September 19, 2006: initial release.

1.1) October 5, 2006: updated release.
     Now available in two formats: a ".zip" and a ".tgz".  Also applied a 
     handful of example updates.  For details on all changes made, see file 
     "pp3e-updates.html" here, or at http://www.rmi.net/~lutz/pp3e-updates.html,
     and look for notes labeled with the date of this release.

1.2) November 16, 2006: updated release
     Non-ASCII characters:
         Fixed non-ASCII characters in 5 files that are now treated as errors as
         of Python 2.5.  These stem from cut-and-paste operations.  The worst of 
         these, in threadtools.py, caused PyMailGUI to fail under 2.5 (but not 2.4).
         See file findNonAscii.py in this directory for the fixed files list.
     PP2E appearances:
         Fixed lingering "PP2E" references in a handful of files to use "PP3E".
         Only one of these was significant: a popup title in PyDemos2 which used
         "PP2E" in both the examples tree and the book.  All others were either
         correct in the book, or in extra examples not presented in the book.
         See file findPP2E.py in this directory for a fixed files list.
     Grids in PyMailGUI:
         In PyMailGUI2, changed to use grid() instead of pack() for layout of 
         mail header fields.  pack() skews the fields on Linux, where the fonts
         sizes are very different than on Windows, the main test platform. 
     New class examples
         Added some new examples from training classes in the Examples/PP3E/Extras
         folder.  These are supplemental, and not shown in the book.
    For details, see "pp3e-updates.html" here, or at "http://www.rmi.net/~lutz"
