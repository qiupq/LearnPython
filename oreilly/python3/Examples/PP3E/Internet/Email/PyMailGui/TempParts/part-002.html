<DIV><FONT face="Kristen ITC">Glad your Canada trip was a success and enjoyable. I've heard and gotten the impression myself, that Canadians are much more laid back than we here in the states. Wow. Weird sentence. I'm sure you understand what I'm trying to say. Would love to live in Vancouver but don't have any connections and am not willing to just move there and fly by the seat of my pants like I did with Nashville back in the latter 80's. It takes so much more to pull up stakes and start over. Not willing to take that big of a risk at this stage of&nbsp;my game.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face="Kristen ITC">I'm excited and antsy for this weekend. I&nbsp;am ready for the gig and the drives to be over with for this season.&nbsp;Would definitely go back again next year if the opportunity presents itself once again. I've had a good and fun season there. </FONT></DIV>
