The 2nd Edition of this book used FTP examples 
that downloaded Python's source code and an
audio file from ftp.python.org.  

Unfortunately, ftp.python.org is no more, as 
of March 2006 (a week before the 3rd Edition's
final draft was due, in fact!).  The Python FTP
service may be reinstated in the future, but 
the current plan is to require HTTP (web) 
downloads instead.

For historical, and possibly future purposes,
the original FTP scripts are included in this
directory.
