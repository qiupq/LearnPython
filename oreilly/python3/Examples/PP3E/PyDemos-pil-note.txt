PyPhoto requires the PIL open source Python 
imaging library to be installed separately, 
for image thumbnail generation, and for viewing
of some photo types.  See the book for details,
and search google to fetch and download PIL.

Also note that images in this distribution and 
its saved mail files were reduced in size and 
resolution to save space.  Use images of your 
own to experiment further.
