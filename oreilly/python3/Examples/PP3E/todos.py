# Run me to convert all text files to MS-DOS line-feed format.
# You only need to do this if an entire text file in this examples
# distribution looks line a single long line, when it is viewed with
# your text editor (e.g., Notepad).  This script converts all files 
# at and below the examples root, and only converts files that have  
# not already been converted (it's okay to run this multiple times).
#
# Since this is a Python script which runs another Python script, 
# you must install Python first to run this program; then from your
# system command-line (e.g., a MS-DOS window), cd to the directory 
# where this script lives, and then type "python todos.py".  You 
# may also be able to simply click on this file's icon in your file
# system explorer, if it knows what '.py' file are (Windows should).
