<H2>Updates</H2>

<p>
<i>Feb-05</i>:
I've posted a new 
<A HREF="lp2e-updates.html">book updates page</A> for this text.
This page is a collection of notes about things omitted from 
the text, changes in Python after the book's publication, and
a few errata that have surfaced over time.  The official
errata (book bugs) list, however, is still maintained at 
<A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lpython2/errata/">O'Reilly's site</A>.
This new page is mostly for author notes, and serves as a sort
of appendix to the book.

<p>
<i>Feb-04</i>:
O'Reilly published an article I wrote titled "When Pythons Attack", which
summarizes common Python programming mistakes, and is based in part
on content from this book.  It's available
<A HREF="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2004/02/05/learn_python.html">
on this page</A>

<p>
<i>Feb-04</i>:
O'Reilly is now maintaining both source-code and an errata list for this
book at their site.  Source-code for examples and exercises is 
<A HREF="http://examples.oreilly.com/lpython2/">available here</A>.  
The errata (corrections) list 
<A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lpython2/errata/">lives here</A>.
A separate book updates list may eventually appear here as well.

<p>
<i>Jan-04</i>:
This book hit #1 on the computer books list at bn.com (Barnes & Noble) in 
January.  It was also #2 on the O'Reilly bestsellers list for two 
consecutive weeks in early February.  At the time that I stopped checking,
it had been in the top 10 there for 3 weeks, and in the top 20 for 5 weeks.

<p>
<i>Jan-04</i>:
This book started shipping as of the last week of December, 2003, and is now
available.  I first saw it when amazon.com shipped a copy to me on December
29.

<H2>Overview</H2>

<p><i>Main support page here</i>: <A href="lp2e-updates.html">updates page</a>.

<P>
A 2nd Edition of the book <A HREF="about-lp.html"><i>Learning Python</i></A>
is in production, and will be available soon.  I submitted a full draft of 
the new core language material on January 9th, and finished a 
final draft on June 9th (and a final final draft on July 6th).

The book went to production in the first week of September, which means it 
will be released in late 2003 (December).

<p>
This new edition has been expanded to cover all the new features of the 
Python language added in the last 4 years--list comprehensions, nested scopes,
new style classes, generators, string methods, and so on--and reflects the 
current Python release, 2.3.  It will also cover new topics and 
examples presented in Python classes I teach.  

<p>
As a result of all the new coverage, the book will likely grow by 150 
to 200 pages in this edition, and be a more complete guide to the Python 
language.  Despite the new material, it retains most of the 1st Edition's 
scope and flavor, and is still designed to be a first book on Python for 
both new and experienced programmers.

<P>
O'Reilly's  description page lives 
<A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lpython2/">here</A>.
Naturally, you can also find a catalog page for the book on 
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com">amazon.com</A> by doing a search;
be sure to look for 2nd Edition details at that site.
