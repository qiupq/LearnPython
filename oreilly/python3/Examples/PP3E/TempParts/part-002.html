        Hello,<BR>
<BR>
As of December 2004, this email address requires new senders to register before 
messages are accepted.&nbsp;If you have a legitimate reason to contact me,      
please take a minute to click on the link at the end of this message, and fill  
out the form requesting to be added to the address book.&nbsp;Once you do, I    
will immediately be able to see this message, any other messages you may have   
sent in the last 7 days, and any future messages you send.<BR>
<BR>
I regret this inconvenience, but spam became completely out of control at this  
address, and stronger filtering was not an option.&nbsp;I am adding some known  
contacts to the address book manually, but if you've received this message you  
are not yet registered.&nbsp;If you prefer to avoid this step, please call by   
phone instead.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
