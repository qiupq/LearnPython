Welcome to the _Programming Python 3rd Edition_ book examples
distribution package.  In this package you will find source 
code for all the examples in the book, along with some extras.

To fetch and install the Python interpreter, please visit the
Download link at www.python.org.  For related packages used
in the book such as PIL, MySQL, ZODB, Zope, and SWIG, please 
search for their latest location with Google or other web search
engine.  The book's examples were known to work under Python 2.4 
and 2.5 and compatible 3rd-party packages, but should generally 
run on later Python releases as well.

The Examples directory here is the book examples source code 
directory.  It contains demo launcher scripts, a tools directory,
and one subdirectory for each part of the book.  The PP3E 
subdirectory here is simply one large Python module package which
you may import from, as long as its container directory (here, 
called Examples) is on your Python module search path.

Demos may be started directly from this package; Launch_PyDemos.pyw
in Examples/PP3E, for instance, runs major GUI and web-based examples.
Source files are distributed in DOS end-line format; see the PyTools 
directory's fixeoln_all.py and README files for conversion tools if 
the code looks odd in your Unix or Linux text editor.  Also see the
book's Preface as well as Examples\PP3E\README-PP3E.txt here for more
information.

A few hints:

- Most image files and save-mail content was stripped to make 
  this package smaller.  Populate these with your own content.

- The "Updates.txt" file here will be updated whenever this book
  examples package changes; see it for the most recent change.

- Be sure to search the web for up-to-date releases of all 3rd party
  packages used in the book.

- Consult www.python.org for links to many other useful packages not 
  used in the book.  See especially the Vaults of Parnassus and PyPI 
  site links there for extra Python software.

- See the book's preface for information about starting example demos
  in this package, tips for running the book's Internet examples,
  and more.
